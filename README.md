# Detecting Machine Failure from IoT Sensors with a SQL Pipeline

# Project description

Companies want to predict when a machine is goiung to fail before it happens. This is because it's so much cheaper to apply Preventive Maintenance than have to go and take a machine of the line and completely have it out of action. 

# Approach

We are going to take the data from a SQL database using Sqlite. Split the data into train and testing to prevent data snooping bias. We will explore sensor data and split features and targets. Reduce dimensionality with PCA. Modelling with a PCA Pipeline step, do the Machine Failure Evaluation and deploy back into the database.
